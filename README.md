# About this project<a id="sec-1"></a>

This project provides a [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix) expression to repackage the proprietary [BluOS Controller](https://bluos.net) for Linux. BluOS is software for managing digital/streaming music bundled with various music streamers and amplifiers.

The "main" branch provides the latest release of 4.2.0 of the controller. See "old/\*" branches for older versions.

This project is unofficial. The official distribution is only for Windows, Macs, and mobile devices. However, it turns out that it's implemented as an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) application, which lends to portability, in this case enabled by some relatively light patching.

This project is only tested against Linux and does not work on MacOS. Use the official BluOS distributions for MacOS or any other platform.

# Building, packaging, and distributing with Nix<a id="sec-2"></a>

Projects such as this one have been birthed by [a post on the official BluOS support forum](https://support1.bluesound.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360033533054-BluOS-controller-app-on-Linux). There's a few projects that do what this project does, but without Nix. Here's a comparison with two of them:

Nix is a package manager we can use to both build and install the controller. NixOS is a distribution that uses this package manager, but we can install Nix on any Linux distribution. Nix can install with not worry of conflict alongside other package managers such as APT, Yum, Pacman, etc.

A primary motivation to use Nix is to reduce build dependencies. This is not dissimilar from the optional usage of Podman or Docker of `bs-bashpatch`, but Nix offers an architecture for reproducible builds well above what Podman or Docker can accomplish. If you're new to Nix this project bundles a few guides to get you started:

-   [Introduction to Nix and motivations to use it](doc/nix-introduction.md)
-   [Nix installation and configuration guide](doc/nix-installation.md)
-   [Nix end user guide](doc/nix-usage-flakes.md)
-   [Introduction to the Nix programming language](doc/nix-language.md)

Ultimately, we're trading off complexity. You take on the complexity of installing the Nix package manager (or running NixOS). After that projects like this can more easily build applications without you having to worry about having the right software installed and configured. All you need is Nix.

# Usage<a id="sec-3"></a>

As discussed in the [end user guide](doc/nix-usage-flakes.md) after [installing Nix with flakes](doc/nix-installation.md), we can run the BluOS controller without even installing it:

```sh
nix run github:shajra/bluos-nix
```

The guide also discusses how to install the application so it's accessible from your `PATH`.

There's also a small [`bluos-controller` script](bluos-controller) at this project's root that will run the exact version checked out from Git, whether you installed Nix with flakes or not.

We generally start the controller with no arguments.

Sometimes it gets a little stuck. If this happens, try hitting `ctrl-r` to reset the application. You can also type `Alt` to see the Electron menu (auto-hidden by default).

The controller is wrapped by `daemon` as a convenience for job control. This way you can have confidence that only one instance is running at a time. Also, you don't have to deal with backgrounding processes or redirecting standard output/error.

You can call the controller with `--help` or `--help-daemon` for more details:

```sh
bluos-controller --help
```

    USAGE: bluos-controller
        [OPTIONS]... [start | start-nodaemon | stop | toggle] [-- DAEMON_ARGS...]
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    
        Runs the BluOS Controller, ensuring that there's only
        one instance running using a PID file.  This is done
        with the 'daemon' program.
    
        You can give a start or stop command.  Otherwise, start
        is assumed.  If you give both commands, the last one has
        precedence.
    
    OPTIONS:
    
        -h --help            print this help message
        -H --help-daemon     print this help message
        -s --scale           DPI scaling factor

# Release<a id="sec-4"></a>

The "main" branch of the repository on GitHub has the latest released version of this code. There is currently no commitment to either forward or backward compatibility.

The "old/\*" branches have older versions of BluOS controller. There might be a motivation to run with an older version intentionally, despite the nagging to upgrade.

"user/shajra" branches are personal branches that may be force-pushed to. The "main" branch should not experience force-pushes and is recommended for general use.

# License<a id="sec-5"></a>

This is repackaging of proprietary software. It is safe to assume that BluOS controls the terms for all copying, modification, and distribution. The copyright is entirely theirs. To my knowledge, there is no license for usage.

Obviously, BluOS wants people to download their official software for use. But it's not clear to what degree they support unofficial repackaging. They could request projects like this to cease and desist. But the more likely scenario is that they are happy to have a community help out with something they don't have time for.

An additional benefit to them is not having to support Linux officially. If any of these repackaging projects has a problem, the burden of fixing it falls on the packager, and not on BluOS. That extends to damages and liabilities as well. But don't worry about that too much. The patching this project does is small, and it's ultimately just a music management application that talks a little over the network.
